<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. I'm Lakshmi Nikhitha from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at SRM University AP. I completed my schooling at Little Flower School, which is affiliated with CISCE, and my intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya Junior College. My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, along with strong knowledge in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express. Coming to my work experience, I interned as a Full Stack Developer at D2 Tech Labs Hyderabad Pvt. Ltd., where I developed and maintained web applications. I also completed a Salesforce Developer internship with SmartInternz, demonstrating proficiency in Salesforce fundamentals, process automation, and advanced development practices. Additionally, as a Web Developer at CodeSwap Solutions, I developed a Netflix clone, enhancing my web development skills. I've undertaken several significant projects such as: Court Chronicle, Classroom Allocation using AI techniques, OCR Transliteration Tool and Multi-threaded Web Crawler. With a strong foundation in high-level programming languages, my strengths include excellent problem-solving skills, adaptability, effective communication, and a collaborative spirit. I am highly motivated and committed to continuous learning and professional development. Besides this, I do have a weakness of being a perfectionist, which sometimes leads to spending more time on tasks than necessary, but I am working on balancing efficiency and attention to detail. So, with my diverse skill set and passion for technology, I am eager to bring my expertise to your team and help drive your company's success.</p>
